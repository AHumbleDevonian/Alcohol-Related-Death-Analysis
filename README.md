# Alcohol-Related-Death-Analysis

Introduction
This project utilises the following resources: 


[Population Estimates for UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland] - https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland

[Statistics on Alcohol, England] - https://data.gov.uk/dataset/statistics_on_alcohol_england 
The following project will conduct an in-depth analysis of the Statistics on Alcohol, England provided by data.gov.uk. The main aim of the project is to unveil meaningful information about Alcohol related death across England from 2001 to 2014, making use of the available information regarding gender and specific cause of death as recorded at the time. 


Additional Resources

To bring context to the raw numbers provided in the Statistics on Alcohol, England, additional resources were pulled from the Population Estimates for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This provides the Population Estimates for England from 2001-2014 which should bring greater clarity to the meaning of the data provided in the main resource.

Raw Numbers

The first piece of analysis will take place using the raw numbers. A preliminary glance shows that the number of deaths across males is almost double of that across females (see R Files – 2014RawNumPieChart.R and RawNumBarChart.R)
The raw data however does not take into account the size of the population. Whilst the raw data seems to indicate a gradual increase in the number of alcohol related crimes, when measured against the total population of England we can see the true picture.
